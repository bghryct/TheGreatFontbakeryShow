# **What is Fontbakery? **
### Fontbakery is Font QA software that can be run on the command line or on the fontbakery dashboard. (insert link to the fontbakery dashboard)

Fonts are complicated and as such can become tedious to check thoroughly. Imagine you've just drawn your superfamily of 81 styles and now it's clipping in legacy Microsoft Office programs from before 2013. Why? Maybe you need a DSIG table, but that wasn't on the menu of things to think about when you made your masterpiece. Fontbakery will check for you. 

Fontbakery is part of a development cycle. As type designers sometimes we don't think of our fonts as software. They're art or they're a tool or they're some other abstract thing. The problem is (all theory aside) in practical terms fonts *are* software. we need to be able to test them as software. Font Development is Software development.
